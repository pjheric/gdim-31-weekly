Nightshade	Medicinal flower with healing properties. The base for healing effects. 	Also called Belladonna, it has been in use for centuries, dating back to Renaissance Italy. While deadly in large amounts, in small doses it is very effective at curing common ailments and ills. Caution is advised as ingesting the flower in its raw form can cause serious harm.	Processing method: grind with mortar and pestle.
Solace Sage	Common painkiller herb. Numbing effects on pain.	A crossbreed of Sage and Hemp, it has been used for several generations as a painkiller. While it is unparalleled in its numbing effects, most large corporations tend to prefer synthetic alternatives. This leaves an almost inexhaustible supply for alchemists.	Processing method: grind with mortar and pestle, then separate with the centrifuge.
Cyclops Eye	An eyeball from a peculiar source. Impacts eyesight.	The cyclopes have been a menace since ancient times. They often will kidnap lost travelers and those living on the edge of towns. Since their true discovery, they are being actively eradicated. Alchemists have found that the eye is the most potent ingredient that can be gathered from the numerous dead. Despite their monocular vision, they have startlingly good eyesight.	Processing method: grind on mortar and pestle, then separate with the centrifuge.
Achia Seed	Vial of powdered seeds. Impacts hair growth.	A close relative to the coffee bean (no not the chia seed), the achia seed has been documented to impact hair growth to a staggering amount. In some cases, it has been found to even awaken long dead hair follicles and cure baldness. However, the recipe for this cure has been lost or is being closely guarded. It can likely be rediscovered, with enough experimentation.	Processing method: grind with mortar and pestle
Vampire Tears	Vial of viscous liquid. Heavily impacts emotions.	Vampires are known for their ability to charm what they consider “lesser beings” such as us humans. As alchemy became a booming business, an alchemist on the fringe of the law attempted to harvest vampire blood for an ingredient. The unfortunate soul quickly found that they had no blood and went missing. But the vampires found that they could trade their tears for a steady food supply. These tears contain a diluted amount of the power to influence emotions.	Processing method: separate with the centrifuge.
Jormungandr Scales	Scales of a once immortal creature. Drastically lowers bodily metabolism.	The discovery of the legendary world serpent was an interesting day for the world. It was the first instance of documented interaction with what was thought to be a mythological being. Though the great serpent is hard to rouse from slumber, it did eventually agree to contribute its scales for various alchemical research. As it drowses its scales are gathered by the ton. Much like the sleeping beast, the scales slow a person and can cause them to enter a similar sleep.	Processing method: grind on mortar and pestle.
Griffin Claws	Pointy and abrasive claws. Impacts muscle growth and movement.	Griffins are a noble avian species that have long lived apart from human society. Until a century ago, these claws had to be scavenged from those dead or ones that had broken in a hunt. But now we have an agreement where they are compensated for each claw and only so many can be contributed by a single griffin. Using this as an ingredient grants you a pale imitation of the species speed and strength.	Processing method: mortar and pestle.
Lightning-in-a-bottle	The spark of creation, in a neat bottle. Greatly enhances metabolism.	Lightning has long been used in alchemy, either for granting power to the potion-crafter or to be an ingredient. But thanks to recent advances, it has been bottled for easy acquisition and use. This does not mean, however, that it should be used lightly. It is still one of the rarest alchemical ingredients out there, it has only recently been able to be created with any efficiency and consistency. Those that have written about it tout its ability to increase cell activity and boost metabolism. Use with care, lightning is not to be trifled with.	Processing method: separate with the centrifuge.
